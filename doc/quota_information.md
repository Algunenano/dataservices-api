# Quota information

This Data Services API provides functions which are subject to quota limitations, and extra fees may apply. Please check our [terms and conditions](https://cartodb.com/terms/) for detailed information about quotas.

The functions that require service credits to be used are as follows:

* cdb_geocode_street_point(_search_text text, [city text], [state text], [country text]_); from [Geocoding functions](http://docs.cartodb.com/cartodb-platform/dataservices-api/geocoding-functions/)
* cdb_isodistance(_source geometry, mode text, range integer[], [options text[]]_); from [Isoline functions](http://docs.cartodb.com/cartodb-platform/dataservices-api/isoline-functions/)
* cdb_isochrone(_source geometry, mode text, range integer[], [options text[]]_); from [Isoline functions](http://docs.cartodb.com/cartodb-platform/dataservices-api/isoline-functions/)

## Quota consumption information and usage recommendations

Be mindful of the following when using the abovementioned functions:

* One credit per function call will be consumed, and the results are not cached. If the query is applied to a _N_ rows dataset, then _N_ credits will be used.
* You are discouraged from using dynamic queries to these functions in your maps. This can result in credits consumption per map view. **Note:** Queries to the Data Services API and any of its functions in your maps may be forbidden in the future.
* You are advised to store results of these queries into your datasets and refresh them as needed, so that you can have finer control on your credits' usage.
